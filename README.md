# Overview

Flow cytometry is a cornerstone of cytometric analysis. By suspending cells in a stream of fluid and passing them through a laser, flow cytometry can measure multiple parameters on single cell simultaneously. 
This technique is essential for immunophenotyping, cell sorting, and a wide range of applications in health, environmental and clinical diagnostics. 
Its ability to provide rapid, high-dimensional data makes it a vital tool in modern biological sciences.
